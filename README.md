# cfg-python-search-recipes-project
A recipe search program that uses Python and the Edamam API to find and print recipes according to the user's chosen ingredient(s) and other search criteria, including preferred cuisine type (e.g. British, Italian, Indian), dietary requirements (e.g. vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free), and maximum calories.
This project was presented alongside with two people as part of our final group project for the [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/)  8-week Introduction to Python Programming course.
